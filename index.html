      <p>For now I will Just talk a litle about me. most of my programing life I have made small desktop apps in C++. Whenever I needed something but couldent find it online I would make it. Today I am switching to Rust. Im looking for a project with more complexity then my small app used to give me as I find its the dificulty and eginering that engages me.</p>

      <p>Im a huge fan of Linux and have been useing it exlusivlely since 2014. What I love most about Linux is that when something breaks you learn somthing new about how it works, at least in my expiriance. My current setup is NeoVIM on Debian with KDE-Plasma on a 2014 Mac Book Pro(I Don't recomend, highly unstable)</p>
